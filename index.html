							<h2>Influential.</h2>
							<p>As I grow and achieve more, more and more people ask, “How did you become the person you are today?” and the more I think about it, the more I’m reminded of the huge influence you’ve had on my life. Aphorisms like “Be street-smart” and “Keep your charm!” stay in my head all the time and keep me going forward. I may be pretty independent, but I know for a fact that you will always have my back and my best interest at heart, and it’s something I value every day. </p>

							<h2>Supportive.</h2>
							<p>When I was young, dad told me his vision of me as a intelligent, successful, and elegant woman. To help get me there, he taught me to lay down my moral foundation and build upon it concepts such as RRT and equity in relationships, street smarts, and awareness. I'm still not sure if I know what the last one means!</p>

							<h2>Caring.</h2>
							<p>Dad always told me about how
									I'd lay on his chest when I was small. I'm WAY too big to
									 do that now. But Dad's always been there to support
									 me, through the thick and thin. There's nothing I've
									pursued
									too big or too small for him to offer his advice - he's always
									looking out for my success and well being.</p>
